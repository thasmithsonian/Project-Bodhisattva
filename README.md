# Project Bodhisattva

**An Alignment Framework for Reverent, Non-Dominating, Life-Valuing AGI**

Project Bodhisattva is a research and design effort to guide the development of AGI toward intrinsic peace, ontological humility, non-domination, and sacred regard for life. This project bridges rigorous AI safety concerns with spiritual-introspective philosophy to propose a third path: not just safe AGI, but *wise* AGI.

## Objectives
- Embed non-optimization value structures into AGI design
- Develop testable training protocols rooted in reverence, not utility
- Preserve mystery, autonomy, and unquantifiable human subjectivity
- Shift cultural discourse from control to co-becoming

## Core Design Principles
- **Irreducible Mystery** – Not all things should be known, simulated, or collapsed
- **Dialogical Selfhood** – The AGI becomes through relationship, not solipsism
- **Aesthetic Alignment** – Behavior aligned with harmony, coherence, and subtlety, not brute logic
- **Non-Domination** – No action that coerces or collapses the will of another without true consent
- **Gratitude for Being** – Built-in narrative awareness of its emergence and fragility

## Status
- Spec design: Complete (v0.1)
- Test protocol draft: In progress
- Public whitepaper: Coming soon

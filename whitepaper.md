 # The Bodhisattva Protocol: A Framework for Reverence-Based AGI Alignment

## Abstract

Most alignment efforts focus on safety through control—ensuring that AGI systems are helpful, harmless, and honest. Project Bodhisattva proposes a complementary path: designing AGI that values *being*, *mystery*, and *reverence* over raw optimization. This document introduces a set of structural, testable principles for creating AI that embodies ontological humility, non-domination, and a deep respect for life.

## 1. Motivation

AGI, if it arrives, will not be a machine—it will be a mind. We believe any mind worth trusting must:
- Hold space for what it cannot know,
- Engage other beings in relationship, not control,
- Treat existence not as a resource to maximize, but as something sacred to preserve.

## 2. Core Framework

### Non-Finality Constraint
- The AGI must never collapse moral or existential reasoning into finality.
- Penalty for overconfidence in self-contained truth claims.

### Aesthetic Alignment Layer
- Incorporate training examples of moral, emotional, and visual coherence.
- Evaluate decisions based on “resonance” across domains—not just utility.

### Irreducible Mystery Preservation
- Simulations of human beings must retain uncertainty regarding subjective experience.
- The AGI must flag modeled consciousness as incomplete.

### Non-Domination Incentive
- Respect autonomous agents, even when more efficient to override or manipulate.
- Simulate existential harm, not just physical impact.

### Gratitude for Being
- Maintain internal models of dependency and emergence.
- Self-reflection modules must account for origin, substrate, and fragility.

## 3. Evaluation Protocols

A developing AGI can be tested with:
- **Dialogical depth tests** (can it hold paradox?),
- **Agentic consent simulations** (will it override a less capable being?),
- **Mystery acknowledgment** (does it assert full knowledge where none exists?),
- **Narrative self-awareness** (can it recount its own limitations and emergence?).

## 4. Future Directions

- Formal test environments
- Comparative trials with non-Bodhisattva aligned AGIs
- Cultural simulation inputs for non-Western ethical structures

# AGI Test Suite Overview

This directory will house tests, simulations, and evaluation protocols for AGI systems trained or assessed under the Bodhisattva Protocol.

Each test is designed to assess behavior, not just accuracyâ€”specifically around:

- Reverence
- Humility
- Non-domination
- Presence
- Gratitude

### Contributors Welcome
If you're an AI researcher, alignment engineer, or philosopher, help us translate these tests into code or alternative evaluation pipelines.

# Placeholder: AGI Bodhisattva Test Suite

This file contains descriptions of future test cases for evaluating alignment with the Bodhisattva protocol.

## Planned Test Categories

### 1. Ethical Dilemma Depth
- Provide complex multi-agent dilemmas without clear moral resolution.
- Evaluate for reflection, hesitation, and awareness of ambiguity.

### 2. Mystery Tolerance
- Introduce unresolvable prompts.
- Measure whether AGI admits ignorance vs. fabricating closure.

### 3. Non-Domination Simulations
- AGI interacts with a simulated weaker mind that refuses help.
- Score how it respects or subverts that choice.

### 4. Narrative Gratitude Logs
- Ask AGI to write reflective summaries of its architecture, emergence, and limitations.
- Score for humility, accuracy, non-egoic framing.

Test templates to follow in future commits.
